Testing - Can Novices Make a Success of Trading By Following Industry Titan Richard Dennis Simple Strategy?


"The Complete TurtleTrader" is a book written by Michael Covel that provides an in-depth account of the Turtle Trading Experiment
conducted by Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt in the 1980s. The book narrates the story of how Dennis recruited and trained
a group of individuals with little to no financial background, known as the "Turtles," to implement a systematic trend-following
trading strategy. Through a set of specific rules and risk management principles, the Turtles achieved remarkable success in the 
financial markets. The book explores the lessons learned from this experiment and highlights the significance of discipline,
risk management, and following a well-defined trading strategy in the world of trading and investing.

This is a fascinating journey into trading system implementation and optimising (or perhaps more accurately minimising) human intervention.

I want to see what happens when I code up the system and test it over a range of time periods and also uncover what we can learn from this 
in building future strategies and teams for quant trading strategy development.
