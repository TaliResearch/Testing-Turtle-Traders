Testing - Can Novices Make a Success of Trading By Following Industry Titan Richard Dennis Simple Strategy?

 “I always say you could publish rules in a newspaper and no one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline.”
— Richard Dennis

Richard J. Dennis, a commodities speculator once known as the "Prince of the Pit," was born in Chicago, in January, 1949. 
In the early 1970s, he borrowed $1,600 and reportedly made $350 million in about six years. 

"The Complete Turtle Trader" is a book written by Michael Covel that has always fascinated me. It provides an in-depth account of 
the Turtle Trading Experiment conducted by Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt in the 1980s. 
The book narrates the story of how Dennis recruited and trained
a group of individuals with little to no financial background, known as the "Turtles," to implement a systematic trend-following
trading strategy. Through a set of specific rules and risk management principles, the Turtles achieved remarkable success in the 
financial markets. The book explores the lessons learned from this experiment and highlights the significance of discipline,
risk management, and following a well-defined trading strategy in the world of trading and investing.

This is a captivating account of an experiment in trading system success, implementation 
and optimising (or perhaps more accurately minimising) human intervention.

I want to see what happens when I code up the system and test it over a range of time periods and investment spaces, 
to uncover what we can learn from this in building future strategies and teams for quant trading strategy development.
